Description of Project: Recreating the popular Facebook game Tetris Battle using the terminal as the GUI

User Interface: The terminal will be split into two screens (Player1 and Player2) and a header bar. The header bar indicates player information (name, lines sent, current score) as well as time remaining in the current battle. The screens will have the Tetris display in the center. On the left is the piece in Hold, while the subsequent pieces are on the right. 

Technical Design: (not exactly sure if these are correct)
Allocating memory - for the tetris board and each tiles. 
Working with files. - possibly write into files player stats, victories, losses, lines sent) 
Finding information about files (stat and such). - to display player stats
Processes (forking, exec etc.). 
Signals - ending the game when someone wins or loses
Pipes (named and unnamed).
Shared memory, semaphores. 
Networking. - the multiplayer aspect of the game, allowing 2P to versuses each other
